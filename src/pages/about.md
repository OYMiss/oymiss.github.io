I am Chongzhuo Yang, a student in the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

Previously, I had the privilege of working as a research intern with Prof. [Zhichao Cao](https://search.asu.edu/profile/4082902) at Arizona State University, where I explored system design on ZNS SSDs<i class="oma-bg oma oma-package" style="margin-bottom:-0.2em;"></i>.
