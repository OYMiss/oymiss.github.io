I am Chongzhuo Yang, a Ph.D student in the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), advised by Prof. [Cheng Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengli7/). Currently, my interests primarily focus on ML/AI systems<i class="oma-bg oma oma-robot" style="margin-bottom:-0.2em;"></i>.

Previously, I had the privilege of working as a research intern with Prof. [Zhichao Cao](https://search.asu.edu/profile/4082902) at Arizona State University, where I explored system design on ZNS SSDs<i class="oma-bg oma oma-package" style="margin-bottom:-0.2em;"></i>.
